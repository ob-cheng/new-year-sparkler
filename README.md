## The Story

I built this project for my little brother who **absolutely loves** New Year sparklers. We initially thought they were completely sold out in stores, so I wanted to make sure he could still have his sparkler fun digitally.

Thankfully, we eventually found some real ones! But I thought this little site played out so nicely that I still wanted to share it with the world.

## Features

-   **Interactive**: Click to light, drag to wave it around. Stick tilts with inertia!
-   **Realistic Physics**: Particle effects, "ghost hand", toss/drop animations, and waving mechanics.
-   **Magic Background**: A procedural "Lamplighter" background where a silhouette lights vintage lamps.
-   **Snow Mode**: Toggle a cozy snowing effect.
-   **AR Mode**: Use your webcam to hold the virtual sparkler (powered by MediaPipe).
-   **Multilingual**: Instructions in English, Russian, and Polish.
