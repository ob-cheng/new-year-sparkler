## 🎆 The Story

I built this project for my little brother who **absolutely loves** New Year sparklers. We initially thought they were completely sold out in stores, so I wanted to make sure he could still have his sparkler fun digitally.

Thankfully, we eventually found some real ones! But this little site turned out so nicely that I wanted to share it with the world. 🌍
