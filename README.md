# New Year Sparkler 🎆

A virtual sparkler experience for the web.

## The Story

I built this project for my little brother who absolutely loves New Year sparklers. We initially thought they were completely sold out in stores, so I wanted to make sure he could still have his sparkler fun digitally.

Thankfully, we eventually found some real ones! But I thought this little site played out so nicely that I still wanted to share it with the world.

## Features

-   **Interactive**: Click to light, drag to wave it around.
-   **Realistic**: Particle effects with trails and "fade out" mechanics.
-   **Infinite Fun**: Just click to get a new one when yours burns out.
-   **Performance Optimized**: Uses object pooling to run smoothly on mobile devices.
